Starch::Plugin::ForManager - Base role for Starch plugins.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyPlugin::Manager;
    use Moo;
    with 'Starch::Plugin::ForManager';
    has foo => ( is=>'ro' );

    my $starch = Starch->new(
        plugins => ['MyPlugin::Manager'],
        foo => 'bar',
        ...,
    );
    print $starch->foo(); # bar

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides no additional functionality to
manager plugins.  All it does is labels a plugin as a manager
plugin so that Starch knows which class type it applies to.
