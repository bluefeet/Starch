=head1 NAME

Starch::Plugin::DisableStore - Disable store read and/or write operations.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $starch = Starch->new(
        plugins => ['::DisableStore'],
        store => {
            class => ...,
            disable_set => 1,
        },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin provides the ability to make stores silently fail
read and write operations.  This can be useful for migrating
from one store to another where it doesn't make sense to write
to the old store, only read.
