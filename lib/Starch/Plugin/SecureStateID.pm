=head1 NAME

Starch::Plugin::SecureStateID - use cryptographically secure random when making state IDs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $starch = Starch->new(
        plugins             => ['::SecureStateID'],
        secure_state_id_sha => 256,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For each state stored in Starch, the generated ID is virtually guaranteed to be unique. It is not generated to be unguessable. By using this plugin, the state will include a random number generated using L<Math::Random::Secure> to assure that is both unique and includes a cryptographically secure random number in the calculated ID.

This plugin also selects upgrades the state ID so that it is calculated using SHA-256 instead of SHA-1. SHA-1 hashed values are potentially guessable for attackers with a large enough budget. A possible downside is that SHA-256 creates a key that is 256 bits long, which results in an ID string that is 64 bytes long, rather than the 40 byte long string provided by SHA-1. The version of SHA used may be chosen with the L</secure_state_id_sha> option.

=head1 OPTIONAL MANAGER ARGUMENTS

These arguments are added to the L<Starch::Manager> class.

=head2 secure_state_id_sha

This names the SHA algorithm to use. It may be set to one of: 1, 224, 256, 284, 512224, and 512256. The default is 256 (though, if you do not use this plugin, SHA-1 will be used).
