   talking about sessions.

0.07 2018-05-17

 - Stop hiding packages from indexing.
 - Some doc fixes to the manual. @IsmailKerim
 - Use MooX::MethodProxyArgs.
 - Some minor documentation cleanup.

0.06 2015-07-31

 - Move the TimeoutStore plugin to a separate distribution.

0.05 2015-07-27

 - Use the short store name when logging store exceptions.
 - Simplified the state lifecycle methods a bit and modified them to be a
   little less opinionated.
 - Plugins can now more reliably extend BUILD via method modifiers.
 - Make sure the TimeoutStore alarm is cleared when an exception is thrown.
 - Use alarm instead of Time::HiRes::Alarm for the TimeoutStore plugin,
   as sub-second alarms cause more unpredictable issues than they are worth.

0.04 2015-07-21

 - Update state's in_store if the store did not find any data.  This
   should provide some minor performance improvements and correct
   behavior.
 - Moved the hash_seed and generate_id methods into the manager.
 - Renamed invalid key to no_store key, which means its named
   after what it causes rather than what it is used for (an anti-
   pattern of sorts, but this key will be used for more general
   purpose stuff).
 - Added a mark_dirty method to state.
 - Moved stringify_key and key_separator from manager to store.
 - Increase test coverage.

0.03 2015-07-20

 - Better Carp handling by setting Starch modules as Internal so that
   the caller information ends up in the user's code.
 - Move state ID validation up to the Manager so it is easier for
   integration libraries to validate the ID.
 - Lots of documentation re-jiggery (still not 100% satisfied).

0.02 2015-07-16

 - Remove all uses of DEMOLISH, they were causing race conditions in
   some cases during global destruction.  Good by LogUnsaved and AutoSave
   plugins.  :(
 - Fix Type::Tiny union constraints sometimes failing on Perl < 5.14.

0.01 2015-07-16

 - First version.
